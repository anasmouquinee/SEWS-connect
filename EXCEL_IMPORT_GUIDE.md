# 📊 How to Import Your Excel Data into SEWS Connect

## 🎯 Your Excel Data Structure

Based on what you showed me, your Excel has these columns:
```
Work Station | Project | Quantity | Workstep Progress | Micrograph Progress | Priority | Prototyping | Locked Look Reason | Good Parts | Creation Date | Target Date | Planned Start Date | etc.
M12         | 40      | 1000     | finished          | Not Requested       | express  | no          | no                 | 1000       | 28.06.2025... | 28.06.2025... | 28.06.2025...     | etc.
```

## 🚀 3 Ways to Import Your Data

### Method 1: Test with Your Exact Data (Easiest)
```bash
# Run the demo I just created
C:\src\flutter\bin\flutter run lib/excel_import_demo.dart
```

Then click **"Import Your Excel Data (First 5 Rows)"** - this uses your exact data structure!

### Method 2: Import from CSV File
1. **Convert Excel to CSV**: Open your Excel file → Save As → CSV format
2. **Run the demo**: `C:\src\flutter\bin\flutter run lib/excel_import_demo.dart`
3. **Click "Import from CSV/Excel File"**
4. **Select your CSV file**

### Method 3: Use in Your Main App
Add this to your existing SEWS Connect app:

```dart
// In your main app
import 'features/workstation/screens/workstation_import_screen.dart';

// Navigate to import screen
Navigator.push(
  context,
  MaterialPageRoute(
    builder: (context) => const WorkstationImportScreen(),
  ),
);
```

## 📱 What Happens When You Import

### 1. Data Processing
- ✅ Reads all your columns: Work Station, Project, Quantity, etc.
- ✅ Parses dates in German format (dd.MM.yyyy HH:mm:ss)
- ✅ Handles priorities (express, normal)
- ✅ Processes workstep progress (finished, Not Requested, etc.)

### 2. QR Code Generation
Each workstation gets a unique QR code:
```
SEWS_M12_40_1738278000000
SEWS_CH18_175_1738278000001
```

### 3. Local Storage
- ✅ Saved with Hive (works offline)
- ✅ Searchable and filterable
- ✅ Ready for QR scanning

## 🔍 Data Mapping

Your Excel columns map to these fields:

| Excel Column          | App Field            | Example Value |
|-----------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| Work Station          | workStation         | M12, CH18     |
| Project               | project             | 40, 275       |
| Quantity              | quantity            | 1000, 275     |
| Workstep Progress     | workstepProgress    | finished      |
| Micrograph Progress   | micrographProgress  | Not Requested |
| Priority              | priority            | express       |
| Prototyping           | prototyping         | no            |
| Good Parts            | goodParts           | 1000          |
| Creation Date         | creationDate        | 28.06.2025... |
| Target Date           | targetDate          | 28.06.2025... |
| Planned Setup Duration| plannedSetupDuration| 13.0          |
